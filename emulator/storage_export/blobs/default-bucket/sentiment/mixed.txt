I really like the opening. It's provocative, daring, and beautiful at the same time. It sets such a good stage for all kinds of possibilities, and I am very excited to see what is going to happen next. And then it happens. The movie falls flat. No development, no story telling. Complete waste of such a promising beginning. I wish the director and writer could spend a few months working on the rest of the script. Given such a nice opening, it is criminal that the rest of the movie is so weak.

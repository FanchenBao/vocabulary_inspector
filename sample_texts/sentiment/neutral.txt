I guess I like the opening, but it is not my favorite. The development of the story is okay, nothing too exciting. The ending seems to pick up the pace a little bit, but it wasn't able to bump the whole movie up a notch. Overall, it's an okay movie. Good for relaxing, but don't expect deep meanings.
